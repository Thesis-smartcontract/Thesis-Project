      Social security will become increasingly overburdened over the next few
      decades, with little institutional sources of backup. The fraction of the 
      population above retirement age will triple in the same amount of time,
      compounding the problems created by the poor infrastructure. State pension systems 
      share the same weakness, with many relying on record high stock market 
      increases to break even. These problems will likely influence our parents in addition 
      to our kids, and better sources of income saving and distribution are needed.

      Age insurance has long been illegal, and often for good reason.
      Trusting third party vendors to handle large sums amounts of money invites corruption.
      Profitting from neighbors' deaths is a cloud of moral ambiguity. We live in a 
      digital age, however, where societies can reap the rewards of retirement sharing 
      without suffering the corruption or mobidity of previous generations' attempts.
      Dividing investment returns among a retirement pool as members pass is the most
      straightforward way of making ends meet through old age. Enforcing that
      contract with the distributed ledger of the blockchain means that no organization
      need enforce the terms of agreement. Advances in genetics provide identity and age
      verification without sacrificing member anonymity. Large scale decentralization and anonymity
      give redistribution the same moral ambiguity as any other modern-day insurance. 
      Self-redistribution among similar aged members, at a rate accessible to the
      majority of Americans is the only extensible and long-term
      solution to the costs of retirement.

    title: 'How the blockchain works',
    text: `
      Both Bitcoin and Ethereum feature a world-wide network of servers, each of which
      contributes their computing power to uphold the integrity of a distributed database.
      The network of servers are called miners, who get paid by the users of a network to
      create "blocks" of transaction histories. Crucially, miners make far more money from 
      contributing to the system rather than working against it. Even if there were a
      a rogue miner, that individual would need to command more than half of the computing
      power of the entire network to defraud the system. \n\r
      Where Ethereum differs from Bitcoin how the market resource of computing power is used.
      The Ethereum network hosts "smart contracts," whose funtions are invoked by users and
      executed using the computing power of miners. Smart contracts allow the Ethereum
      ecosystem to host any imaginable set of programs that benefit from the transparancy and 
      lack of 3rd party oversight on the blockchain. Popular examples include voting systems
      and blind auctions.

      Outward signs of aging have been visible since humans started living longer than
      a decade or two, but inward signs have only become visible more recently. DNA ages
      every time it replicates, yielding shorter telomeres and increasingly methylated
      strands at every pass. Recent papers have estimated age with a 6 year window 
      with ever-increasing accuracy, giving a reliable, even if glacially paced, machanism
      for identifying individuals based on age. Using a mailed-in lip swab, we can very
      cheaply verify both a person's age, as well as if they have aged since the last test.
      Our contract only requires the swab at signup, and regularly during dividend
      dispersal. Swabs are mailed in, so as to ensure user anonymity. Genetic tests are only
      contributed to collections for big data analysis with user permission.

      The dividends are only as reliable as the market, as with all investment
      strategies. Identical twins, unfortunately for us, cannot be distinguished soley
      by their DNA, so they cannot be reliably identified. The genetic testing involves
      statistical analysis, which always involves margins of error. Therefore, pools are grouped
      in clusters of ages rather than single years. Fund withdrawl can disadvantage other
      participants, so there are time restrictions and early exit penalties. Conctracts
      are susceptible to security flaws, and are difficult to update. We built in ways to
      handle unforeseen problems, but distributed contracts are only as strong as the code.
